## Overview

This is a solution to the [Huddle Landing Page on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-alternating-feature-blocks-5ca5f5981e82137ec91a5100) 

This challenge is to build a responsive static landing page using the technology which aims to test the skills of building responsiveness components. I also make this more challenging by trying to integrate with framer motion to make animations and transitions.
## Tech Stack
- ReactJS - to simplify each section into components
- TailwindCSS - to style up the page with an ease
- Framer Motion - a motion library for React
## Challenge
The only issue I struggle the most is when I tried to operate the Framer Motion which I never used before. I had to scroll through the docs while doing the project and it took me some time to understand how to use it. However, I managed to overcome this problem by keep trying and finding information from the community. At the end, it turns out great and smooth which is exactly what I expected at the first place.
## What could be improved

To be honest, I have no idea what could be improved in this static site page. One of them would probably be the responsiveness that I was spending some time on it.
